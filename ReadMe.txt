Welcome to my model of a classroom. The time is approximately 6PM.
Please use Firefox (preferably on Linux but works on Windows too, of course.)!! 
Chrome is sluggish across different machines and OSs

The available commands are:

	-arrow keys: look around

	-w: move in direction you are facing
	-s: move away from what you are facing
	-a: strafe left
	-d: strafe right
	-q: strafe upwards
	-e: strafe downwards
	
	-m: move chairs backwards
	-n: move chairs forwards
	
	-k: close blinds
	-l: open blinds

	-o: open door
	-p: close door

	-c: erase board
	-v: write on board
	
	-1: toggle front left light
	-2: toggle front right right
	-3: toggle back left light
	-4: toggle back right light

I reccomend to not have all the lights on when the blinds are open othewise your students will go blind!

Enjoy.
